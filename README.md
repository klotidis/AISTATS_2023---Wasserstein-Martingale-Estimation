# AISTATS_2023---Wasserstein-Martingale-Estimation

Code corresponding to the paper "Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Linear-Quadratic Estimation under Martingale Constraints" published in the Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on Artificial Inteligence and Statistics (AISTATS) 2023, Valencia, Spain. PMLR: Volume 206.

- For reproducing our results, run the file “script.m”.

- For computing the estimators WMMSE-Conditional and WMMSE-Future we used the openly available code  “FrankWolfe.m”, “linear_oracle.m”, “my_bisection.m” and “dual_solution.m” from: https://github.com/sorooshafiee/WMMSE
